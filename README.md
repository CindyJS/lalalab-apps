This repository contains the exhibits of two collections: [ShowMeMusic](http://science-to-touch.com/LaLaLab/ShowMeMusic/) and [BeatBox](http://science-to-touch.com/LaLaLab/BeatBox/).

## Installation (together with applauncher2)

Run `install.sh`, which will download the [applauncher2 of IMAGINARY](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/applauncher2) as submodule and add the corresponding configuration files.

Host everything on a web server. Then the two collections can be opened though `applauncher2/?cfg=showmemusic` and `applauncher2/?cfg=beatbox` respectively.
