# lalalab-apps

A collection of exhibit-ready [CindyJS](https://cindyjs.org/) applications made for the [Lalalab exhbition](https://lalalab.imaginary.org).
These applets are supposed to be served through the [applauncher2 of IMAGINARY](IMAGINARY/applauncher2).

This repository contains the exhibits of two collections: [ShowMeMusic](http://science-to-touch.com/LaLaLab/ShowMeMusic/) and [BeatBox](http://science-to-touch.com/LaLaLab/BeatBox/).

## Installation with applauncher2

Download this repository and the [applauncher2 of IMAGINARY](IMAGINARY/applauncher2).
Copy the files `lalalab-apps/showmemusic.config.yml` and `lalalab-apps/beatbox.config.yml` to the folder `applauncher2/config/`. Put the folder `lalalab-apps` into `applauncher2`. This could be done through the commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/CindyJS/lalalab-apps.git &&
git clone https://github.com/IMAGINARY/applauncher2.git &&
cp lalalab-apps/showmemusic.config.yml applauncher2/cfg/ &&
cp lalalab-apps/beatbox.config.yml applauncher2/cfg/ &&
mv lalalab-apps applauncher2

```

Host the folder `applauncher2` on a web server. Then the two collections can be opened though `index.html?cfg=showmemusic` and `index.html?cfg=beatbox` respectively.
