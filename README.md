# lalalab-apps

A collection of exhibit-ready [CindyJS](https://cindyjs.org/) applications made for the [Lalalab exhbition](https://lalalab.imaginary.org).
These applets are supposed to be served through the [applauncher2 of IMAGINARY](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/applauncher2).

They can be launched at [https://cindyjs.github.io/lalalab-apps/](https://cindyjs.github.io/lalalab-apps/).

This repository contains the exhibits of two collections: [ShowMeMusic](https://cindyjs.github.io/lalalab-apps/applauncher2/?cfg=showmemusic) and [BeatBox](https://cindyjs.github.io/lalalab-apps/applauncher2/?cfg=beatbox).
